<h1>What Does "Second-Order-Subdomain" Mean?</h1>

A first-degree subdomain takeover is when a subdomain (e.g. store.example.com) is directly outside your control.

A second-degree attack is not a subdomain, but rather a poorly structured resource used in relation to that subdomain. <br>
For example:
<br><br>
External JavaScript (<script src="...">)<br>
Links (<ahref="...">)<br>
CSS (<linkhref="...">)<br>
CORS response headers



<h2>REQUIREMENTS:</h2>
1-python3<br>
2-pip install requests beautifulsoup4 urllib3


<h2>USAGE:</h2>
1-Enter the domain you want to scan in the domain section at the bottom of the code.<br>
2-Use this command "python3 SOST.py" or "python SOST.py"
